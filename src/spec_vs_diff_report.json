The implementation includes a responsive frontend with Home, About, Services, and Contact pages using React/TypeScript/Tailwind, a Motoko backend for contact form storage, and a spiritual design aesthetic with custom fonts and color palette. However, the testimonials section is only present on the Home page rather than having a dedicated page, and the generated images are correctly referenced but not included in the diff files.",
